We see Typeahead everywhere, either in Google Search or Twitter Search, when we type something, a suggestion layer gives us the possible result we want.

You are asked to design a Typeahead widget.

This is a vague question, please discuss the scope with your interviewer.

For FrontEnd, UI performance, API performance, Caching, Modularization, Animation & Timing might be the shining point.
