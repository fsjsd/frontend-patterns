# Messenger

https://bigfrontend.dev/design/design-a-messenger-app

Please design a messenger app, like Facebook Messenger.

Super vague problem, please clarify scope with your interviewer.

Different from other timeline-based product, messenger is for realtime chatting, so things like how to make it realtime, offline problem, read status, group, server performance could be your shining points.

Good luck!
