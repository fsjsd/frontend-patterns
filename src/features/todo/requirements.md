Yeah it is a TODO app again.

You must be fed up with all those examples of TODO app. If you are asked to design a TODO, what would be your approach?

Try to answer it with emphasizing on the shining point of yourself.
Try to cover all the aspect of a web app, like SEO/performance/security .etc
Try to make it cool with unique features from your mind, with cool animations.
Try to modularize it with small components and modules, and pick one or two to shine. .etc
...
